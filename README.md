# i3dots

I personally prefer to do this on any arch based distro since it worked the best for me 
Install picom, polybar, rofi and i3-wm
Go into your ~/.config/ file and replace the folders.
You also need to install Departure Nerd font. Go here https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads and search for "Departure" then extract the zip file and install it.
